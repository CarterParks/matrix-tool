# matrix-tool
A shell tool designed to make it easier to work with matrices.
## Current operations:

* Add, Subtract

* Multiply by Scalar

* Multiply by Matrix

All operations are performed with the current matrix as the first term in the operation. Current matrix can be switched between created matrices. Operation menu will show a list of valid matrices that the operation can be performed upon. For example: Say the current matrix is the 2 x 2 *Matrix A*. Also extant are 2 x 1 *Matrix B* and 1 x 3 *Matrix C*. Selecting the **Multiply by Matrix** option on Matrix A would list only Matrix B as an available option.
